Analysis by Felipe Suarez, all this information was taken from my Visual Code output to identified significant patterns on credit risk classification. 

[[14493    68]
 [   31   466]]
This is my Matrix output 
True Positives 466: Highrisk loans correctly identified.
True Negatives 14,493: Lowrisk loans correctly identified.
False Positives 68: Lowrisk loans classified as high-risk by mistake.
False Negatives 31: Highrisk loans classified as low-risk ny mistake.
This is my analysis for was it was correctly classified and by mistake too.

Tjhis is the output for my Classification Report 
Precision (1.00 for class 0, 0.87 for class 1): The model is highly precise, especially for predicting low-risk loans.
Recall (1.00 for class 0, 0.94 for class 1): The model is very effective at identifying actual high-risk loans.
F1-score (~0.90 for class 1): Great balance for precision and recall for the highrisk loans.
Accuracy (0.99): Overall the model is 99% accurate, meaning it performs pretty accurate.

Report on Credit Risk Analysis
1. Overview
This analysis's goal is to use a logistic regression model to assess loan risk. This model uses borrower financial data to determine if a loan is **low-risk (0)** or **high-risk (1)**.
2. Results - Confusion Matrix: - Model Accuracy: 99%

METRICS
Accuracy: 87% (high risk), 100% (low risk)
Recall: 94% for high-risk and 100% for low-risk
90% is the F1-score (high-risk).

3. Synopsis The logistic regression model predicts loan risk with great accuracy. 99% of loans are appropriately identified by it. Nevertheless, 31 highrisk loans were mistakenly categorized as lowrisk, and 68 lowrisk loans were mistakenly marked as highrisk.  
This model works very well for risk assessment because of its excellent recall and precision. Predictions could be further improved,
Recommendation: Given its great accuracy and potent prediction ability, this model is advised for implementation in this case.
